        WHAT IS FORTNITE? BEGINNER'S GUIDE 9.2.2020 By The Fortnite Team
        Fortnite is a world of many experiences. Drop onto the Island and
        compete to be the last player — or team — standing. Hang out with
        friends to catch a concert or a movie. Create a world of your own with
        your own rules. Or Save the World by taking down hordes of monsters with
        others. FORTNITE GAME MODES There are four major game modes in Fortnite,
        together offering something for every kind of player. These four modes
        are: Battle Royale, Party Royale, Creative, and Save the World. BATTLE
        ROYALE Available on consoles, PC, and mobile, Fortnite Battle Royale is
        free to download and play! Hop off the Battle Bus to the Island below
        and battle it out to be the last one remaining. Or team up with friends
        or other players to outlast other teams. Use the power of wood, brick,
        and metal to build structures to help you out. There’s always something
        to look forward to in Fortnite Battle Royale, including new items,
        weapons, vehicles, submodes, special events, and “Seasons.” Each new
        Season brings a distinct theme to the Island, like the past secret agent
        takeover and giant flood.
